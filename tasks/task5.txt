Main Goal:
#### Create a initialization function to set up our Model Context Protocol (MCP) 


Tasks:
1. Create a new tool for the AI to initialize the MCP set up server in "src/index.ts"
2. The tool will create a new rule file in `.cursor/rules` named `always-mcp-doc-search.mdc`.
3. In the front-matter, set  
   ```yaml
   ---
   alwaysApply: true
   ---
   ```
4. Rule description:  
   "Cursor must always consult the MCP documentation corpus before any other source.  
    If no relevant MCP doc is found, only then may alternate searches run."
