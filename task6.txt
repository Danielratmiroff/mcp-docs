Main Goal:
#### Enforce MCP-First Documentation Search via Cursor Rule

Tasks:
1. Create a new rule file in `.cursor/rules` named `always-mcp-doc-search.mdc`.
2. In the front-matter, set  
   ```yaml
   ---
   alwaysApply: true
   ---
   ```
3. Rule description:  
   "Cursor must always consult the MCP documentation corpus before any other source.  
   • If no relevant MCP doc is found, only then may alternate searches run.  
   • Searches that skip MCP or ignore it should be rejected."
4. Add default settings (if supported by the rule engine):  
   • `mcp_search_required: true`  
   • `fallback_to_web: false`  
   • `auto_inject_rule: true`
5. Update existing rule index / documentation so this rule is always loaded.
6. Verify by running a sample query and confirming Cursor triggers an MCP search first.
