# CONTEXTO MCP

You MUST use the 'CONTEXTO' MCP tool kit to retrieve the project's up-to-date documentation, best practices,
code examples, folder structure, project architecture,
and other relevant information that might be useful for fulfilling the user's request.

You should ALWAYS consult the 'CONTEXTO' MCP documentation when you are unsure or have a question about the project's architecture, best practices, or other relevant information.

You MUST generate a new index of the documentation every time you create, modify, or delete a file in the ai_docs folder.
