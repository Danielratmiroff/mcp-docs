# Contexta

Contexta is a Model Context Protocol (MCP) documentation server that makes your project's documentation available to AI assistants. Enabling them to follow your project's best practices and architecture.

## Main Features ü§ñ

- **Context to AI assistants:** Make your project's documentation available to AI assistants.
- **Semantic Search:** Find the right document just by asking questions.
- **Documentation Management:** Empower AI assistants to easily create, read, and delete documentation files.
- **AI Integration:** Sets up configuration files to seamlessly connect with AI tools like Cursor and Gemini.

## How to Use üîç

Contexta pulls your up-to-date documentation and uses it as context for your LLM prompt.

1. Write your prompt naturally.
2. The AI will determine if it needs to use Contexta to anwser your question more effectively.

or enforce the use of Contexta by appending "use contexta" to your prompt.

Examples:

```text
Create a Next.js middleware for JWT authentication with cookie validation and login redirect. use contexta
```

No manual searches, no outdated code, just real-time docs in your context.
