test(reindex-docs): add unit tests for reindex-docs functionality

Adds a comprehensive test suite for the `reindex-docs` function.

The new tests cover the following scenarios:
- No changes in the documentation directory.
- Addition of a new documentation file.
- Deletion of an existing documentation file.
- Modification of an existing documentation file.

The tests utilize mocks for the file system (`fs/promises`) and the `@xenova/transformers` library to ensure isolated and predictable test execution.
